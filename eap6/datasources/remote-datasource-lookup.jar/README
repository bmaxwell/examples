Setup:

In the JBoss profile, change the ExampleDS to be as shown below.  Only things bound into java:jboss/exported/ can be looked up remotely

                <datasource jndi-name="java:jboss/exported/datasources/ExampleDS" pool-name="ExampleDS" enabled="true" use-java-context="true">

This test will show the NotSerializableException as remote datasources are not supported in EAP 6 as they have negative issues.  The recommendation is to use an EJB to access the datasource and then call the EJB remotely.
